# Data analysis sample scripts
In this repository there are two folders. Folder **R** and **Python**.
## R directory 
1. [Chris-2D R sample.R](https://github.com/SamirSH/Chris-2D/blob/main/R/Chris-2D%20R%20sample.R "Chris-2D R sample.R")  which is sample script from implementation of HIBAG on DiMelli dataset starting from data preparation until producing performance statistics. For confidentiality I do not show any data and plots of the results.
2. [PredictLabels.R](https://github.com/SamirSH/Chris-2D/blob/main/R/PredictLabels.R "PredictLabels.R") is helper function for [Chris-2D R sample.R](https://github.com/SamirSH/Chris-2D/blob/main/R/Chris-2D%20R%20sample.R "Chris-2D R sample.R") which converts predictable HLA genotypes to DR-DQ serotypes.

## Python directory
- [Chris-2D python sample.ipynb](https://github.com/SamirSH/Chris-2D/blob/main/Python/Chris-2D%20python%20sample.ipynb "Chris-2D python sample.ipynb") contains sample script from T1DGC data set analysis, where it starts from data preparation, implementing logistic regression with nested cross-validation, plotting ROC-AUC curves, feature visualization and analysing AUC score against top-ranked features. For confidentiality I do not show any data and plots of the results.
